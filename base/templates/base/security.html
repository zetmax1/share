        <h2>2. Data Protection and Privacy:</h2>
        <h3 class="sw-privacy-subtitle">2.1 Data Minimization:</h3>
        <p>We collect only the essential information required to provide you with a seamless and valuable experience.
            This includes your username, email address (for account verification and communication), and any information
            you choose to share in your profile or posts.
            Secure Storage: Your data is stored on secure servers with industry-standard encryption. We employ robust
            security protocols to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or alteration of your information.</p>
        <h3 class="sw-privacy-subtitle">2.2 No Third-Party Selling: </h3>

        <h2>3. Account Security</h2>
        <p>Strong Passwords: We strongly recommend using strong, unique passwords for your account. Avoid easily
            guessable passwords and consider using a password manager.
            Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): For enhanced security, we offer Two-Factor Authentication (2FA). Enabling
            2FA adds an extra layer of protection to your account, requiring a verification code in addition to your
            password. [Explain how to enable 2FA or provide a link to instructions].
            Account Monitoring: We actively monitor accounts for suspicious activity. If we detect any unusual behavior,
            we may temporarily suspend the account and contact you for verification.
            Regular Security Audits: We conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential
            vulnerabilities.</p>

        <h2>4. Content Moderation and Safety:</h2>
        <p>Community Guidelines: We have established clear Community Guidelines to ensure a respectful and safe
            environment for all users. These guidelines prohibit the sharing of malicious content, personal attacks, and
            other harmful behavior. [Link to Community Guidelines].
            Reporting Mechanisms: We provide easy-to-use reporting mechanisms for users to flag inappropriate content or
            behavior. Our moderation team promptly investigates all reports and takes appropriate action.
            Malware and Phishing Protection: We actively scan content for malware and phishing attempts. We also educate
            our users about online safety best practices to help them avoid scams and other threats.
            Responsible Sharing: We encourage users to share accurate and reliable information. While we strive to
            maintain the integrity of the content on our platform, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of all
            user-generated content. Always verify information from multiple sources before relying on it.</p>
